Hello and welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe.py V.1 !!!
The rules are simple:
    1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

    2. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

    3. The first player to get 3 of his/her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

    4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

Have fun!!!
