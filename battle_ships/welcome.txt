Welcome to Battle_Ships.py V 1.0

This small terminal game is based on the board version, with a few alterations.

The rules are simple:
The first player who destroys the ships of his opponent wins.

1. You start by placing your names.
2. You proceed, then, by placing your ships on the your grid one player at a time.
3. Then you take turns shooting at each others grid.
   * Each player has one grid and at this stage of the game you will be
     viewing your opponent's grid.(without the ships, of course)

   * If you hit a ship a R, for red, wil appear on the position which you fired.
     In case you hit 'sea', a W for white will appear

<<<<  GOOD LUCK !  >>>>
