The  players should type their names.

First player is the one that types
his/her name first.

X is assigned to the first player and moves first.

A symbol (O/X) may be placed only in an empty space.

A player wins by being the first to connect
a line of friendly pieces from one side or corner of the board to the other.

The game ends when either one player wins or it is
no longer possible for a player to win (in which case the result is a draw)


Enjoy!!!
